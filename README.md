# BlogSite using FastAPI and React

Developed a full-stack web application using FastAPI as the back-end framework and React on the front-end. Utilized an asynchronous architecture to handle multiple requests and improve performance. Incorporated SQLAlchemy as the ORM and PostgreSQL as the database management system. The application allows for the creation, reading, updating and deletion of blog posts, with features such as user authentication and authorization, pagination and filtering of posts and integration with external APIs.

To run the server use the command

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```
